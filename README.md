They say a good developer eats his own dog food. Here is mine.

__Warning__: do not actually feed this to dogs. This is mainly for
students, which are a lot like dogs, but have to eat human RDAs.

Recipe
------

* 150g peanuts
* 100g lentils
* 300g rice
* 10g Lo Salt
* 5g Bouillon + 500ml boiling water
* 2 tbsp coriander seeds
* 1 tbsp cumin seeds
* Other spices (tsp each): turmeric, cinammon, allspice and black pepper.

Boil lentils in a large saucepan with plenty of water for 15 minutes, then
drain.

Rinse that pan out and dry it, then toast the peanuts for a couple of
minutes. Add the coriander seeds and cumin seeds and keep toasting for
another minute. Add the rice, salt and other spices and mix everything up 
quickly, then add the cooked lentils and the stock. Bring to the boil and
simmer for 15 minutes on a very low heat.

After 15 minutes turn off the heat and leave it for 10 minutes.
